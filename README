I. Introduction
===============

I.1. dm-zoned
-------------

The dm-zoned device mapper provides transparent write access to zoned block
devices (ZBC and ZAC compliant devices). It hides to the device user (a file
system or an application doing raw block device accesses) any sequential write
constraint on host-managed devices and can mitigate potential device-side
performance degradation with host-aware zoned devices.

For a more detailed description of the zoned block device models and
their constraints see (for SCSI devices):

http://www.t10.org/drafts.htm#ZBC_Family

and (for ATA devices):

di537r05-Zoned_Device_ATA_Command_Set_ZAC.pdf

dm-zoned implementation focused on simplicity and on minimizing overhead (CPU,
memory and storage overhead). For a 10TB host-managed disk with 256 MB zones,
dm-zoned memory usage per disk instance is at most 4.5 MB and as little as 5
zones will be used internally for storing metadata and performaing reclaim
operations.

I.2 dm-zoned-tools
------------------

dm-zoned backend devices can be formatted and checked using the dmzadm utility.

Usage: dmzadm <operation> <device path> [options]
Operations:
  --help | -h	: General help message
  --format	: Format a block device metadata
  --check	: Check a block device metadata
  --repair	: Repair a block device metadata
Common options(all operations):
  --verbose	: Verbose output
  --vverbose	: Very verbose output
Format options:
  --seq <num>	: Number of sequential zones reserved
	          for reclaim. The minimum is 1 and the
		  default is 16

II. Algorithm
=============

dm-zoned implements an on-disk buffering scheme to handle non-sequential write
accesses to a zoned device sequential zones. Conventional zones are used for
this, as well as for storing internal metadata.

The zones of the device are separated into 2 types:

1) Metadata zones: these are randomly writeable zones used to store metadata.
Randomly writeable zones may be conventional zones or sequential write
preferred zones (host-aware devices only). Metadata zones are not reported as
useable capacity to the user.

2) Data zones: All remaining zones, the majority of which will be sequential
zones. These are used exclusively to store user data. The conventional zones
(or part of the sequential write preferred zones on a host-aware device) may
be used also for buffering user random writes. Data in these zones may be
permanently mapped to the randomly writeable zone initially used, or moved
to a sequential zone after some time so that the random zone can be reused for
buffering new incoming random writes.

dm-zoned exposes a logical device with a sector size of 4096 bytes,
irrespectively of the physical sector size of the backend zoned device being
used. This allows reducing the amount of metadata needed to manage valid blocks
(blocks written). The on-disk metadata format is as follows:

1) The first block of the first randomly writeable zone found contains the
super block which describes the amount and position on disk of metadata blocks.

2) Following the super block, a set of blocks is used to describe the mapping
of the logical chunks of the target logical device to data zones. The mapping
is indexed by logical chunk number and each mapping entry indicates the data
zone storing the chunk data and optionally the zone number of a random zone
used to buffer random modification to the chunk data.

3) A set of blocks used to store bitmaps indicating the validity of blocks in
the data zones follows the mapping table blocks. A valid block is a block that
was writen and not discarded. For a buffered data zone, a block can be valid
only in the data zone or in the buffer zone.

For a logical chunk mapped to a random data zone, all write operations are
processed by directly writing to the data zone. If the mapping zone is to a
sequential zone, the write operation is processed directly only and only if
the write offset within the logical chunk is equal to the write pointer offset
within of the sequential data zone (i.e. the write operation is aligned on the
zone write pointer). Otherwise, write operations are processed indirectly using
a buffer zone: a randomly writeable free data zone is allocated and assigned
to the chunk being accessed in addition to the already mapped sequential data
zone. Writing block to the buffer zone will invalidate the same blocks in the
sequential data zone.

Read operations are processed according to the block validity information
provided by the bitmaps: valid blocks are read either from the data zone or,
if the data zone is buffered, from the buffer zone assigned to the data zone.

After some time, the limited number of random zones available may be exhausted
and unaligned writes to unbuffered zones become impossible. To avoid such
situation, a reclaim process regularly scans used random zones and try to
"reclaim" them by rewriting (sequentially) the valid blocks of the buffer zone
to a free sequential zone. Once rewriting completes, the chunk mapping is
updated to point to the sequential zone and the buffer zone freed for reuse.

To protect internal metadata against corruption in case of sudden power loss or
system crash, 2 sets of metadata zones are used. One set, the primary set, is
used as the main metadata repository, while the secondary set is used as a log.
Modified metadata are first written to the secondary set and the log so created
validated by writing an updated super block in the secondary set. Once this log
operation completes, updates in place of metadata blocks can be done in the
primary metadata set, ensuring that one of the set is always correct.
Flush operations are used as a commit point: upon reception of a flush
operation, metadata activity is temporarily stopped, all dirty metadata logged
and updated and normal operation resumed. This only temporarily delays write and
discard requests. Read requests can be processed while metadata logging is
executed.

IV. Usage
=========

A zoned block device must first be formatted using the dmzadm tool. This will
analyze the device zone configuration, determine where to place the metadata
sets and initialize on disk metadata blocks.

Ex:

dmzadm --format /dev/sdxx

For a formatted device, the target can be created normally with the dmsetup
utility. The following options can be passed to initialize the target.

Parameters: <zoned block device path> [Options]
Options:
  rlow=<perc>      : Start reclaiming random zones if the percentage
		     of free random data zones falls below <perc>.
  idle_rlow=<perc> : When the disk is idle (no I/O activity), start
                     reclaiming random zones if the percentage of
                     free random data zones falls below <perc>.
